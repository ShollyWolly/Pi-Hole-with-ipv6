# Pi-Hole-with-ipv6

I tried running Pi-Hole in a docker container but I coudln't get it to work with ipv6 traffic in a docker-compose. That is (at least as far I understood) that docker-compose does not support ipv6 out of the box. But I didn't want to change too much on my docker-configuration so I used this Bash skript instead that does a normal container set up.
